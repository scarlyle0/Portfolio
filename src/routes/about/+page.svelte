		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			I recently graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz, with a degree in Computer Science.
			My journey into technology began with a fascination for video games and how they worked, which ultimately led me to pursue a career in software development.
			I found a passion for building software that invites interaction and brings enjoyment to others.
			Through my job and personal projects, I have gained valuable experience in languages like JavaScript and Python, but I am always looking to improve.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also have a passion for game development and really enjoy the creative challenge.
			I am currently seeking opportunities to improve my craft and work on important projects that foster collaboration and encourage continuous learning.
